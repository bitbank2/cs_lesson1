A CS lesson for learning C programming
This code is meant to demonstrate how to work with pointers and pixels
The goal of this lesson is to successfully convert the color bitmap
to be identical to the reference grayscale bitmap. The first time the
code is run, the test will fail because the MakeGray() function is empty.
When the MakeGray() function has been written correctly, the test will
pass.

To compile and run the program type at the command line:

make
./cs1
